	  "car" package to test for the presence of hurdles.
	* A vignette about count data regression in R has been added
	  (which in particular explains the ideas behind zeroinfl() and
	  hurdle()).

	  and the normalize option

	  binomial(link = linkstr) instead

0.74	* deprecating meanzero option in ideal, replace with normalize
	* new options for specifying start values in ideal (eigen, random,
	  or user-supplied list); this fixes a bug reported by Boris Shor

	  object when overlaying cutting planes
	* plot.ideal.Rd: more examples (but in \dontrun)
	* tracex: bug for 2d ideal objects
